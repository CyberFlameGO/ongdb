To get started and for more information about ONgDB and Shell go to https://graphfoundation.org.

Use this component to connect to a
* local ONgDB graph database
* remote already running ONgDB instance (NOTE:
  GraphDatabaseService.enableRemoteShell() must have been invoked)

Quick start: 

Issue the following command:

    java -jar ongdb-shell-{version}.jar

Make sure to replace {version} with the actual version.
The ongdb-kernel jar file need to be in the
same directory or on the classpath.
